      Outside of learning coding, I enjoy playing soccer with my friends and
      going out to eat when I can.

    <h3>
      Hey there, I am Abdi Shirdon and an upcoming full stack developer. I
      cannot wait to learn more everyday.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Hi there! I am a developing software engineer with the abilities of
      creating, designing, and testing new applications. I have a passion for
      computer science and I am always looking for new opportunities in
      furthering my career and skills. I have the ability to contact and
      communicate with my team directly to ensure we meet our expectations. I am
      a team player with utmost dedication to my work and wanting to learn every
      chance I get. At OSU, I was a civil engineer major and later on, I
      discovered my true passion which was creating applications as a software
      engineer. I am very excited about my future in the tech world and will
      continue implementing new methods and skills as time goes on
    </p>
